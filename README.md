#Brain MRI segmentation using UNet on PyTorch

This repo is mainly inherited from PyTorch's example on Brain MRI segmentation using UNet
The link to the pytorch's example is below:
https://github.com/mateuszbuda/brain-segmentation-pytorch

The Dataset is provided on Kaggle and the link is below:

I have uploaded the weights trained for 50 epochs in the weights folder

I have also writter my own UNet model for experiment
